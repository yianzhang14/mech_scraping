What Are the Advantages of UC Nylon?  Maximum Light Transmittance  UC Nylon was developed with RGB fans in mind and aims to offer maximum light diffusion through fully transperant housings. Additionally, new molds were developed for the material with polished cavities to minimize visible abberrations.    Improved Smoothness  UC Nylon is a curated blend designed to reduce the course nature of pure nylon without impacting other favorable properties of nylon such as sound. Coupled with new polished molds, these switches aim to be a step above full nylon compositions.    Enhanced AcousticsUC Nylon utilizes a special blend to provide a deeper, fuller sound as you bottom and top-out your switches. As the bottle suggests, these switches contain 100% thock.

With this in mind, I had two primary goals with this switch - to provide full and even housing collisions ",http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0064/2560/8282/products/IMG_2233_1200x1200.jpg?v=1662428673,$6.00,Sold out,Default Title  - Sold out," From the designer:  Background:Sick of thin, cheap sounding and feeling switches, I wanted to provide something different to a lot of the newer linears on the market, specifically those manufactured by Durock/JWK. With this in mind, I had two primary goals with this switch - to provide full and even housing collisions while maintaining that level of smoothness that enthusiasts have come to expect in recent years. After multiple rounds of prototyping, the Blush linear switch is ready to be run in its final form.For the top housing, while prototypes were made with both polycarbonate (PC) and nylon plastic, polycarbonate was chosen over nylon to provide a better overall typing feel. Nylon leads to the switch feeling ‘flat’ and sounding dull and introduces slightly more scratch to the keystroke - similar to that of stock MX Blacks. Polycarbonate was determined to be the better choice because of the higher level of smoothness it provides, as well as the poppier sound signature.Dual-stage springs are generally longer than normal springs, which tend to be around 15mm in length. The springs used in the Blush linear switch are 20mm in length, which is significantly longer than standard 15mm springs. Because of the extra length, the spring is pre-compressed in the switch, making it heavier at the start of the keystroke, which also leads to a snappier return, providing more feedback when typing. Not only does this deliver a more satisfying typing experience, but it also helps towards combating the slight thinness in feel that polycarbonate top housings can introduce - by topping out with greater force.The stem is made of POM and has a pole that’s longer than normal linear switches. The extra length improves the sound of the switch and causes a sharper, hard-hitting bottom out. Just like the dual-stage spring, the longer stem also helps to increase typing feedback and provides a more satisfying and ‘full’ feeling.Nylon is a great all-rounder material for bottom housings, which is why it’s seen in many switches. It has high wear resistance and is relatively hard, which is necessary to keep the switch working well even when abused during long gaming sessions.ManufacturerThe switch is manufactured by Aflion, as denoted by the branding on the top housing. While being a relatively new manufacturer, the quality of their switches is exceptional. Over the last few months, samples from various manufacturers have been tested to find the one most suited to provide the level of quality I was seeking. After seeing what Aflion had to offer, I was immediately very impressed and chose to work with them closely to bring my vision into a product that I was happy with. Aflion’s switches tend to have thicker housings, similar to those of Tecsee, while coming at a cheaper price point. The thicker housings provide a more solid and premium typing feel, in line with the design goals of the switch.Switches are sold in packs of 10.Quantity 1 = 10 switches. Specifications:  Linear

Similar to their inspiration, the switches are sure to provide creamy acoustics with minimal modifications. They're also intended to be a V2 to our beloved Blue Velvet Switches from 2021. Several improvements have been made since then including a revised PME formula to minimize flaking, updated molds for improved tolerances, and dual stage gold plated springs for a snappier response. As part of our Fruit Milk Series of switches they will also include a matching collectible milk bottle, and sticker!    What is PME?  PME is a proprietary plastic blend developed to achieve a deeper sound signature than other traditional plastics. The material was first introduced in 2021. The sound is much deeper than polycarbonate, and arguably slightly deeper than nylon.    What Improvements Have Been Made?  Revised PME Formula  Our original Blue Velvet switches occasionally experienced flaking of the internal surfaces. Flaking would sometimes need to be removed depending on its size. Our Banana Milks will feature a newly developed PME formula aimed to improve smoothness, and minimize flaking.    Updated Molds  New molds have been created for improved tolerances, and smoothness. The new switches have tighter housings, and reduced stem wobble.    Updated Springs  Dual stage gold plated springs are now included in the switches to improve both sound and feel. These longer springs provide a slightly higher initial force, steady force increase, and snappy return.    Switches are sold in packs of 10.  Quantity 1 = 10 switches.Specifications:  Linear

Additionally, the switches are lightly pre-lubed with an improved factory lubing technique to ensure they're ready to go as soon as they arrive!  What's new with V2?The biggest change in V2 has been the reduction in the number of runners in the injection molding process. Previously in V1 there were 24 runners. In V2 there are now only 16 runners. For those unfamiliar with injection molding, a runner is a channel cut into the mold that allows for the plastic to flow from the nozzle into each cavity. Decreasing the number of runners and cavities allows for better control and consistency resulting in better tolerances and smoothness. Additionally, new molds are generally smoother than older molds due to pristine internal surfaces.    Switches are sold in packs of 10.  Quantity 1 = 10 switches.  Specifications:  Linear

As part of our Fruit Milk Series of switches they will also include a matching collectible milk bottle, and sticker!  What is PME?  PME is a proprietary plastic blend developed to achieve a deeper sound signature than other traditional plastics. The material was first introduced in 2021. The sound is much deeper than polycarbonate, and arguably slightly deeper than nylon.    What Improvements Have Been Made?  Revised PME Formula  Our original Blue Velvet switches occasionally experienced flaking of the internal surfaces. Flaking would sometimes need to be removed depending on its size. Our Banana Milks will feature a newly developed PME formula aimed to improve smoothness, and minimize flaking.    Updated Molds  New molds have been created for improved tolerances, and smoothness. The new switches have tighter housings, and reduced stem wobble.    Updated Springs  Dual stage gold plated springs are now included in the switches to improve both sound and feel. These longer springs provide a slightly higher initial force, steady force increase, and snappy return.    Switches are sold in packs of 10.  Quantity 1 = 10 switches.Specifications:  Tactile

Inspired by the countless iced drinks we've had this summer - these switches feature a fully transperant housing composed of a new formula developed in collaboration with Tecsee called Ultra Clear (UC) Nylon, and a matching collectible milk bottle!  What Are the Advantages of UC Nylon?  Maximum Light Transmittance  UC Nylon was developed with RGB fans in mind and aims to offer maximum light diffusion through fully transperant housings. Additionally, new molds were developed for the material with polished cavities to minimize visible abberrations.    Improved Smoothness  UC Nylon is a curated blend designed to reduce the course nature of pure nylon without impacting other favorable properties of nylon such as sound. Coupled with new polished molds, these switches aim to be a step above full nylon compositions.    Enhanced Acoustics  UC Nylon utilizes a special blend to provide a deeper, fuller sound as you bottom and top-out your switches. As the bottle suggests, these switches contain 100% thock.

They're constructed with the extremely smooth molds the community is familiar with from JWK. They feature an extended long pole stem made of LY for exceptionally satisfying bottom-out feel and acoustics. This is coupled with an improved factory lubing technique, making them arguably great without modding.  What is LY?  LY is an UHMWPE blend made by JWK aimed to combine UHMWPE's natural lower coefficient of friction, self-lubricating properties, and resistance to abrasion with enhanced structural integrity. UHMWPE on its own is an extremely soft material prone to deforming in instances of high stress such as when stems are friction fitted into keycaps. This can result in wobble, or in extreme cases keycaps simply falling off. This blend ensures those issues do not occur. Additionally, the increased rigidity will produce a louder, fuller sound on bottom-out than a comparable pure UHMWPE stem.    Switches are sold in packs of 10.  Quantity 1 = 10 switches.Specifications:  Linear
