Fittingly, it has a heavy operating force of 65±10gf, making it ideal for gamers or heavy typists who want a distinct press and less typos when keyboarding at high speed.  Yang (white) is Yin's opposite. This linear mechanical keyboard switch represents light, fire, and weightlessness. With a medium operating force of 46±10gf, it'll help you breeze your way through games, or keep your fingers fresh after long hours of writing code or text.  It's only fitting that two switches representing eternal forces should be made of long-lasting materials. The cases are made of high-strength, high-resistance nylon. The shafts are made of POM, a low friction plastic that offers scratch-free action. The internals are made of highly conductive copper alloy with superior corrosion resistance.

pro purple (tactile)
Pro Purples offer medium spring resistance and Kailh’s take on an ergonomic tactile response. They’re a potential upgrade path for people who like MX Browns, especially in mixed use scenarios. The Pros are more responsive in games and offer better bottom out performance for daily typists.
pro light green (clicky + tactile)
Looking for a professional clicky switch? The Pro Light Green offers a soft, comfortably tactile keystroke and a muted click that might be OK for some office settings. Maybe. As an added bonus, you don’t need to press as far down to activate these switches.
pro burgundy (linear)
Pro Burgundies offer a nice compromise between linear Kailh Speed switches and standard models. Their early activation point might prove useful in time critical reflex-limited applications, like rhythm game macropads and audio control interfaces. Or you can use them in a keyboard.
